SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS - QUICK EXAMPLE
================================================================================

PROBLEM:
max Z = 3x1 + 2x2
x1 + x2 <= 4
2x1 + x2 <= 5

OPTIMAL SOLUTION (from Simplex):
x1 = 1, x2 = 3, Z = 9
Basic Variables: {x1, x2}
Non-Basic Variables: {s1, s2}

Final Table:
  Cb    B    x1   x2   s1   s2   RHS
  2     x2   0    1    2    -1   3
  3     x1   1    0    -1   1    1
  Zj         3    2    1    1    9
  Zj-Cj      0    0    1    1

EXAMPLE 1: Find Range for C1 (coefficient of x1)
================================================================================

STEPS:
1. x1 is BASIC (appears in basis with value 1)
2. Current C1 = 3
3. Let C1 = C (variable)

4. Calculate Zj-Cj for non-basic variables as function of C:

   For s1:
   Zj = 2×(2) + C×(-1) = 4 - C
   Zj-Cj = (4 - C) - 0 = 4 - C
   
   For optimality: 4 - C >= 0
   Constraint: C <= 4

   For s2:
   Zj = 2×(-1) + C×(1) = -2 + C
   Zj-Cj = (-2 + C) - 0 = C - 2
   
   For optimality: C - 2 >= 0
   Constraint: C >= 2

5. RANGE: 2 <= C1 <= 4

INTERPRETATION:
- Current value C1 = 3 is within range ✓
- If C1 = 1.5: Outside range, solution will change
- If C1 = 3.5: Within range, solution stays same (x1=1, x2=3)
- If C1 = 5: Outside range, solution will change

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 2: Find Range for C2 (coefficient of x2)
================================================================================

STEPS:
1. x2 is BASIC (appears in basis with value 3)
2. Current C2 = 2
3. Let C2 = C

4. Calculate Zj-Cj for non-basic variables:

   For s1:
   Zj = C×(2) + 3×(-1) = 2C - 3
   Zj-Cj = (2C - 3) - 0 = 2C - 3
   
   For optimality: 2C - 3 >= 0
   2C >= 3
   C >= 1.5

   For s2:
   Zj = C×(-1) + 3×(1) = -C + 3
   Zj-Cj = (-C + 3) - 0 = 3 - C
   
   For optimality: 3 - C >= 0
   C <= 3

5. RANGE: 1.5 <= C2 <= 3

INTERPRETATION:
- Current value C2 = 2 is within range ✓
- Can increase up to 3
- Can decrease down to 1.5
- Beyond these limits, basis changes

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 3: Change C1 from 3 to 5
================================================================================

STEPS:
1. Update Cj: [5, 2, 0, 0]
2. Update Cb (x1 is basic): [2, 5]

3. Recalculate Zj:
   For x1: Zj = 2×0 + 5×1 = 5
   For x2: Zj = 2×1 + 5×0 = 2
   For s1: Zj = 2×2 + 5×(-1) = 4 - 5 = -1
   For s2: Zj = 2×(-1) + 5×1 = -2 + 5 = 3
   For RHS: Zj = 2×3 + 5×1 = 11

4. Calculate Zj-Cj:
   x1: 5 - 5 = 0 ✓
   x2: 2 - 2 = 0 ✓
   s1: -1 - 0 = -1 ✗ (NEGATIVE!)
   s2: 3 - 0 = 3 ✓

5. CONCLUSION: NOT OPTIMAL
   - s1 has Zj-Cj = -1 < 0
   - s1 should enter basis
   - Need to continue with simplex

6. NEW OBJECTIVE VALUE (before re-optimizing):
   Z = 5×1 + 2×3 = 11 (but not optimal)

================================================================================
EXAMPLE 4: Change C1 from 3 to 3.5
================================================================================

STEPS:
1. Update Cj: [3.5, 2, 0, 0]
2. Update Cb: [2, 3.5]

3. Recalculate Zj:
   For s1: Zj = 2×2 + 3.5×(-1) = 4 - 3.5 = 0.5
   For s2: Zj = 2×(-1) + 3.5×1 = -2 + 3.5 = 1.5

4. Calculate Zj-Cj:
   s1: 0.5 - 0 = 0.5 ✓
   s2: 1.5 - 0 = 1.5 ✓

5. CONCLUSION: STILL OPTIMAL!
   - All Zj-Cj >= 0
   - Same solution: x1 = 1, x2 = 3
   - New objective: Z = 3.5×1 + 2×3 = 9.5

VERIFICATION:
3.5 is within range [2, 4] ✓

                                 Above 4: s1 enters basis

x2 (C2)   2        [1.5, 3]      Below 1.5: s2 enters basis

PRACTICAL USE IN EXAMS
================================================================================

QUESTION: "For what range of the coefficient of x1 does the current 
          basis remain optimal?"

ANSWER:
1. Identify that x1 is basic
2. Write Zj-Cj expressions for non-basic variables
3. Set each expression >= 0
4. Solve for range: 2 <= C1 <= 4

QUESTION: "If the coefficient of x1 changes from 3 to 5, what happens?"

ANSWER:
1. 5 is outside the range [2, 4]
2. Recalculate Zj-Cj values
3. Zj-Cj for s1 becomes -1 < 0
4. Solution is no longer optimal
5. Need to perform additional simplex iterations
6. s1 will enter the basis
