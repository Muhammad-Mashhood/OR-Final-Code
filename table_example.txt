# Example Simplex Table File Format
# This is a sample table that can be loaded into the program
# Lines starting with # are ignored

# Problem Type (max or min)
max

# Number of decision variables
2

# Number of slack/surplus variables
3

# Number of constraints (rows in table)
3

# Cj values for all variables (x1, x2, s1, s2, s3)
3 5 0 0 0

# Basic variable names (one for each constraint)
x2 s2 s3

# Cb values (objective coefficients of basic variables)
5 0 0

# Table rows: coefficients for each variable + RHS
# Each row: x1 x2 s1 s2 s3 RHS
