# SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS - CASE 2: RHS CHANGES
# Test file for resource/RHS value changes

# Example Problem (from textbook)
# Max Z = 3x1 + 5x2
# Subject to:
#   x1 <= 4
#   2x2 <= 12
#   3x1 + 2x2 <= 18
#   x1, x2 >= 0

max
2
3
3 5
1 0 4 1
0 2 12 1
3 2 18 1

# Expected Optimal Solution:
# x1 = 2, x2 = 6, Z = 36
# s1 = 2 (resource 1 not binding)
# s2 = 0 (resource 2 binding)
# s3 = 0 (resource 3 binding)

# CASE 2 ANALYSIS:
# 
# 1. Resource 1 (b1 = 4):
#    - Not binding (s1 = 2)
#    - Shadow price = 0
#    - Can change within range without affecting solution
#
# 2. Resource 2 (b2 = 12):
#    - Binding (s2 = 0)
#    - Shadow price > 0 (valuable resource)
#    - Changes will affect optimal value
#
# 3. Resource 3 (b3 = 18):
#    - Binding (s3 = 0)
#    - Shadow price > 0 (valuable resource)
#    - Changes will affect optimal value

# TEST SCENARIOS:
#
# A. Change b2 from 12 to 14:
#    - Resource 2 is binding
#    - Should recalculate X_B using B^-1
#    - Check if new solution is feasible
#    - If feasible: update table and show new Z
#    - If infeasible: apply dual simplex
#
# B. Find feasibility range for b3:
#    - Calculate B^-1
#    - For each basic variable: X_B + Δ * B^-1[i][3] >= 0
#    - Find range where all constraints satisfied
#
# C. Find shadow prices:
#    - For resource 1: should be 0 (not binding)
#    - For resource 2 and 3: should be positive
#    - Shadow price = Zj of corresponding slack variable
