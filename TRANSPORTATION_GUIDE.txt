TRANSPORTATION PROBLEM - USER GUIDE
====================================================================

OVERVIEW:
The Transportation Problem solver implements complete solution methodology
with three initial solution methods and MODI optimization algorithm.

====================================================================
FEATURES:
====================================================================

1. INITIAL SOLUTION METHODS:
   - Northwest Corner Method
   - Least Cost Method
   - Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM)

2. OPTIMIZATION:
   - MODI Method (Modified Distribution Method)
   - Complete step-by-step solution
   - All intermediate calculations shown

3. DEGENERACY HANDLING:
   - Automatic detection (when allocations < m + n - 1)
   - Adds epsilon values to maintain required allocations
   - Shows which cells receive epsilon

4. DETAILED OUTPUT:
   - Transportation tables at each iteration
   - u and v value calculations
   - Opportunity cost (Pij) calculations
   - Loop path with arrows (-->)
   - Sign (+/-) for each cell in loop
   - Allocation adjustments shown step-by-step

====================================================================
FILE FORMAT (problem.txt):
====================================================================

SIMPLE AUTO-DETECT FORMAT:
Each row contains: cost1 cost2 ... costN supply
Last row contains: demand1 demand2 ... demandN

The dimensions (M sources, N destinations) are auto-detected.

EXAMPLE (3 sources x 4 destinations):
--------
19 30 50 10 7
70 30 40 60 9
40 8 70 20 32
7 9 18 14

Explanation:
- First 3 rows: cost matrix with supply at end of each row
- Row 1: costs [19,30,50,10] and supply 7
- Row 2: costs [70,30,40,60] and supply 9  
- Row 3: costs [40,8,70,20] and supply 32
- Last row: demands [7,9,18,14]

====================================================================
USAGE:
====================================================================

1. From Main Menu, select option 9 (Transportation Problem)

2. Choose input method:
   - Manual Input: Enter all data step-by-step
   - Load from File: Reads from problem.txt

3. Program checks if problem is balanced:
   - If Total Supply = Total Demand: Proceed
   - If Unbalanced: Add dummy source/destination manually

4. Choose initial solution method:
   - Northwest Corner: Fast, starts from top-left
   - Least Cost: Allocates to minimum cost cells first
   - VAM: Best initial solution, uses penalties

5. Press Enter to proceed through each iteration:
   - View current allocation table
   - See u and v calculations
   - Review opportunity costs
   - Observe loop formation
   - Watch allocation adjustments

6. Solution stops when optimal (all opportunity costs >= 0)

====================================================================
EXAM PREPARATION TIPS:
====================================================================

1. INITIAL SOLUTION:
   - Show all steps of chosen method
   - Create allocation table after each step
   - Calculate total cost

2. DEGENERACY:
   - Count allocations (should be m + n - 1)
   - If fewer, mention "DEGENERATE" and add epsilon
   - Show epsilon placement

3. MODI METHOD:
   - Start with u[S1] = 0
   - Calculate remaining u and v using ui + vj = cij
   - Show equation for each calculation
   - List all u and v values

4. OPPORTUNITY COSTS:
   - Only calculate for empty cells
   - Use formula: Pij = cij - ui - vj
   - Show calculation for each empty cell
   - Identify most negative

5. LOOP FORMATION:
   - Start from entering cell
   - Alternate horizontal/vertical moves
   - Only use allocated cells (plus entering cell)
   - Show path with arrows: (S1,D2) --> (S1,D3) --> (S2,D3) --> (S2,D2) --> (S1,D2)
   - Mark + and - signs

6. ALLOCATION ADJUSTMENT:
   - Find minimum in negative (-) cells
   - Add to positive (+) cells
   - Subtract from negative (-) cells
   - Show before/after values

7. NEXT ITERATION:
   - Create new allocation table
   - Repeat MODI process
   - Continue until optimal

====================================================================
REQUIREMENTS FOR FULL MARKS:

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
====================================================================

1. Not checking for degeneracy
2. Forgetting to set u[S1] = 0
3. Calculating opportunity costs for allocated cells
4. Not showing loop path clearly
5. Forgetting +/- signs in loop
6. Not showing iteration-by-iteration tables
